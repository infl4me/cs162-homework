Current repository contains my solutions of Berkley's "COMPUTER SCIENCE 162 â€” OPERATING SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM PROGRAMMING" [course](https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/courseguides/CS/162). Assigments: [link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs162/fa20/)

# Overview
The purpose of this course is to teach the design of operating systems and operating systems concepts that appear in other advanced systems. Topics covered include operating systems, systems programming, networked and distributed systems, and storage systems, including multiple-program systems (processes, interprocess communication, synchronization), memory allocation (segmentation, paging), resource allocation and scheduling, file systems, basic networking (sockets, layering, APIs, reliability), transactions, security and privacy.
