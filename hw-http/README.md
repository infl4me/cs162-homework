# Overview

The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) is the most commonly used application protocol on the Internet
today. Like many network protocols, HTTP uses a client-server model. An HTTP client opens a network
connection to an HTTP server and sends an HTTP request message. Then, the server replies with an HTTP
response message, which usually contains some resource (e.g. file, text, binary data) that was requested by
the client.
In this assignment, you will implement a HTTP server that handles HTTP GET requests. You will provide
functionality through the use of HTTP response headers, add support for HTTP error codes, create directory
listings with HTML, and create a HTTP proxy. The request and response headers must comply with the
HTTP 1.0 protocol.
