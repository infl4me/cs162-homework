# Overview

In this homework, you will gain familiarity with threads and processes from the perspective of a user program,
which will help you understand how to support these concepts in the operating system. Along the way, you
will gain experience with the list data structure used widely in Pintos, but in the context of a user program
running on Linux. We hope that completing this assignment will prepare you to begin Project Userprog,
where you will work with the implementations of these constructs in the Pintos kernel. Our goal is to
give you experience with how to use them in userspace, to understand the abstractions they provide in an
environment where bugs are relatively easy to debug, before having to work with them in Pintos. It will also
help you to see how you can do a lot of your development and testing of project code in a contained user
setting, before you drop it into the Pintos kernel.
